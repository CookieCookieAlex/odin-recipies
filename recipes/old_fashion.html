    <h4>
      Old Fashion is a "Man's Man" drink or whatever they like to call it.<br />
      Some people love to drink it because of its origin story and others love
      to drink it because it's a drink so...<br />
      Anyway, the drink has its bitterness and sweetness to it with a bourbon
      aroma. Best garnish for old fashion would be a orange twist.
